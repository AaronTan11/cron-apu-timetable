This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app@latest`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

I'm using pnpm and pushed this repo with pnpm-lock.yaml so if you want to use other package manager, **please delete the file**!

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Steps

NOTION_TOKEN="your_secret_token"
